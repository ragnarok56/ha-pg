# what is happening?

![diagram](./assets/diagram.png)

- the `demo-app` polls haproxy on port `5432` to check connectivity
- haproxy is configured to route requests to the 3 patroni instances, using the rest api port `8008` to health check status.  only the active/primary db will return a 2xx response and requests will route there.
- patroni will sync with consul cluster and register/deregister themselves as needed to ensure only 1 node is tagged with `master`
